# sticker_trigger.py

"""
Parser for the sticker trigger block emitted by the LLM.

Canonical SPEC:
  (no reply)
    # Â«stickerÂ»

    WendyAI
    ðŸ˜€

  (with reply)
    # Â«stickerÂ» 1234

    WendyAI
    ðŸ˜˜

Rules:
- Header MUST be exactly "Â«stickerÂ»" (with guillemets) after a '#' markdown header.
- Optional decimal reply target may appear on the header line.
- After the header, skip any number of empty/whitespace-only lines.
- Next non-empty line = SET short name (e.g., WendyAI).
- Next non-empty line = STICKER name (emoji or short name).
- Leading/trailing spaces on those lines are ignored.
- During development ONLY we allow "missing set line" (old behavior) where
  only one non-empty line follows the header; in that case it is taken as the
  sticker NAME and set is None. This will be disabled before merge.

This module is PURE parsing; no Telegram/Telethon calls here.
