# Reset Context On First Message

This section is a marker. If it is present in an agent's specification, it causes the agent to erase all plans and conversation summaries at the "start of a conversation" (when history is empty).

It also causes the same behavior when a `clear-conversation` task is executed.

The contents of this section in the agent specification are ignored.
