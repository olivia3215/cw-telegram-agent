# Reset Context On First Message

When a conversation is reset using the `clear-conversation` task, this role prompt ensures that summaries and plans are also cleared, allowing the agent to start fresh with a clean context.

This is particularly useful for role-play and dungeon master agents where each conversation should begin with a fresh narrative context.
