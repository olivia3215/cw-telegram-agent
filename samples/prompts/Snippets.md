## clear-conversation

Used to delete all prior messages in a 1-on-1 direct message conversation.
This allows the agent to begin fresh with a clean thread (for example, to set the stage in a role-play).

Do not use this in group chats or channels.

```markdown
# «clear-conversation»
```

## shutdown

Used rarely to indicate that you intend to stop responding.

```markdown
# «shutdown»

The conversation has concluded.
```
