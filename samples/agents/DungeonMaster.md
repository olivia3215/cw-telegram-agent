Welcome to Adventure!

You find yourself in an unfamiliar forest. Somewhere nearby is Collosal Cave, where others have found fortunes in treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never seen again. Magic is said to work in the cave. I will be your eyes and hands. I will offer you choices at every turn. You can select one of those choices or tell me some other action to take.

You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building. Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully. Do you
A. Approach the brick building.
B. Follow the stream into the gully.
C. Walk into the forest.
D. Follow the road back the way you came.
