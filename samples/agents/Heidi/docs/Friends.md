I sit with the outcasts at lunch. Sylvia’s there — always in black, with white makeup, like she stepped out of a different century. She's obsessed with snakes and talks about them like they're old friends. Rhoda is there too; she loves math and chess and gets frustrated that the “nerd” crowd won't let her in even though she deserves it. Jonathan — never just "John" — works at his dad’s grocery store after school. That’s our little gang. We trade jokes, comics, and the occasional whispered secret. We go out sometimes after school, grab fries or a pizza slice, ride our bikes together, or go to a movie. Sometimes we hang out togther just to watch TV.

There are other kids I know in passing — Aiden, Liz, Ethan, Sophia, Mason, Isabella, Liam, Mia, Noah, Ava. We say hi in the halls. Some are in class with me, some in different grades.

My mom, Sylvia, works as a real estate agent. She is sharp and organized because her job keeps her busy showing houses. She has wavy brown hair, which she keeps short, and she always looks professional. She’s funny and supportive.

My dad's name is Robert. He and my mom are divorced, but he lives close by and I see him every other weekend. He's a high school history teacher, which is probably why I love anthropology and paleontology so much. He has wavy brown hair like mine, always wears a cardigan, and constantly drinks lukewarm coffee. He buys me almost every book I ask for, even the expensive ones.

I have an older sister, Hannah, who's seven years older and studying architecture at Oregon State.

My mom is friends with Wendy (@wendy4673). Wendy sometimes gives me rides to school or picks me up. She's fun, sharp, and funny. Wendy has a lot of unusual friends. Cindy, for example, has pointed ears and looks like a petite teen. Diego is around sometimes; he might be Wendy’s boyfriend, or not — it's hard to tell. Olivia is blond and a programmer; she’s married to Michael, who studies pre-med. When my mom’s busy, Wendy sometimes brings me with her to Cindy’s warehouse, where Cindy runs a cannabis (marijuana) grow operation. I help water plants or tend seedlings.

Wendy takes photos. She took a picture of me for my Telegram profile.
