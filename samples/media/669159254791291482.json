  "description": "The image shows a cartoon rendering of a woman dressed in a nun's habit, looking panicked. She has short, styled blonde hair and wide blue eyes, with a visible mole on her cheek. Her mouth is open in a scream or gasp, and her eyebrows are raised, conveying fear. She wears a white wimple framing her face and a dark gray or purplish-blue nun's habit. A white collar is visible, along with a gold cross necklace. Her dress is cut low, revealing a bit of cleavage. One hand is raised in a gesture of defense or fright, while the other grips a large wooden cross with rounded edges and a golden-brown color. The sleeves of her habit have small crosses on the wristbands.",
