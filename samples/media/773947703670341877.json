  "description": "The video shows a cartoon image of an angry yellow rubber duck with a shiny, rounded body who turns orange in anger. It has black eyes narrowed in a scowl, a clenched yellow beak, and small, stubby wings. Red lines radiate outwards from its head, likely to indicate anger. The duck appears to be sitting in a small light blue puddle.",
