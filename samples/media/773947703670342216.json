  "description": "The video features a cartoon yellow rubber duck with a bright orange beak. The duck is outlined in a darker yellow, and sits on a thin, light blue line, as if in water. At the beginning of the video, it is sitting and looking at us. Then it takes a piece of paper and folds it into a paper airplane. Finally, it launches the paper airplane, as if to send a letter.",
