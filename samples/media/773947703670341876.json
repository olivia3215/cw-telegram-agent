  "description": "A cartoon animation depicts a rubber duck with wide eyes, whose pupils grow and shrink, suggesting an internal struggle or a catatonic state due to PTSD. An olive-green helicopter appears in a cloud in the foreground briefly, suggesting what's on the duck's mind. The helicopter's rotor blades spin, while the vehicle hovers over tall, green grass-like plants.",
