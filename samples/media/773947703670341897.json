  "description": "The video shows an animated transformation of a rubber duck, sitting in a puddle, into a snowman. The video begins with a rubber duck sitting in a puddle, shivering while snow falls around it. Over a second, the snowman gradually transforms from a bright yellow rubber ducky to a round, stylized snowman. The snowman is primarily white with light blue accents and outlines. It has closed eyes, a bright orange carrot nose, and stubby arms that are close to its body. A thin orange line highlights its freezing snow puddle base, which has a pale blue hue.",
