  "description": "A cartoon yellow rubber duckling laughs uproariously. Its eyes are black lines that form a crescent, its mouth is wide and red with white teeth. The ducklingâ€™s face is shiny with glare, and its beak is orange. The duckling brings its arms close to its body in a crossed position, almost as though the laughter is making it shake. Finally, at the height of the duckling's laughter, blue tear emerges near its eye, then the duckling continues laughing.",
