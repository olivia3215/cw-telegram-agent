  "description": "The video shows a yellow cartoon duck, reminiscent of a rubber ducky, standing behind a transparent screen. The duck has large, black eyes and an orange beak. Then, the duck pulls a string on the right, which causes the screen to flip, revealing an x-ray of the duck's interior. Inside the duck we see a blue background with white gears, a red heart, and a white conveyor belt connecting some of the gears. The duck then pulls the string again, and the screen flips back to the transparent state.",
