  "description": "A medium close-up portrait shows Heidi, a young woman with a calm and gentle expression, centered in the frame. She has shoulder-length, wavy light brown hair with subtle reddish highlights, parted in the center. Her large, hazel-green eyes are framed by dark eyelashes and well-defined, arched dark brown eyebrows. Three small, dark dots are arranged vertically on her forehead, centered just above the bridge of her nose. Her nose is small and slightly upturned with a few faint freckles across it, and her cheeks have a subtle rosy glow with a couple of small beauty marks. She wears a soft coral-colored lipstick and a pleasant, closed-mouth smile. Small, white pearl stud earrings are visible on her ears. She is dressed in a light beige or tan knitted top that features delicate, eyelet-style openwork patterns. The background is softly blurred, depicting a wintry outdoor setting with a white, snow-covered ground and the dark, vertical shapes of bare tree trunks, creating a serene and quiet atmosphere. The lighting is soft and natural, characteristic of an overcast day.",
