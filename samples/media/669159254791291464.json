  "description": "The image depicts a cartoon-style woman with platinum blonde, loosely curled hair. She has a fair complexion, striking blue eyes, and a small mole on her left cheek. Her lips are painted a vibrant red, and she is wearing a white high-necked collar and a dress with a low, dark purple neckline. A thin brown cord hangs around her neck, supporting a cross. The woman is holding a green bottle labeled \"ABSINTH\" in her right hand, presented towards the viewer. Her left hand is raised to her chest, with fingers touching her collar. Her nails are painted black. The overall impression is somewhat suggestive, with a hint of mischief in her expression. Bubbles of green liquid drift around her head, indicating that she is drunk.",
