  "description": "A cartoon image depicts a blonde woman dressed as a nun, operating a Ouija board. The nun has pale skin, closed eyes, red lipstick, and a beauty mark near her lips. She is wearing a white wimple covered by a long, draping habit in shades of lavender and dark purple. Her white collar reveals a generous cleavage, adorned with a golden crucifix on a matching chain. Her hands rest on a triangular, light-brown planchette placed on the Ouija board. The board, also light-brown, is inscribed with the words \"OUIJA\" at the bottom, followed by \"YES\" and \"NO\" on either side. Above this, the letters of the alphabet are arranged in a semi-circular fashion. Floating above the nun's head is a golden question mark.",
