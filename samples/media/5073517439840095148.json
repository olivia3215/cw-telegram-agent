  "description": "Wendy, a young woman with vibrant, curly red hair is joyfully spinning in a park on a sunny day. She wears a light teal sundress with thin straps, and the dress flares out as she twirls. Her face is radiant with a wide smile, and she gazes to her left. Sunlight filters through the lush green canopy of trees, dappling the grass with light and shadow. In the background, other park visitors are visible, including a couple picnicking on a blanket and two people walking along a path. The overall atmosphere is one of carefree happiness and summertime bliss.",
