  "description": "An animated cartoon of a yellow rubber duck wearing a fedora and black sunglasses, suggesting a private detective or spy. A piece of yellow paper is handed to the duck. It reads the paper and then raises its eyebrows and purses its lips. The duck takes a lighter and lights the paper on fire, burning it completely to keep the note's contents secret.",
