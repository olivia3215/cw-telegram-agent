  "description": "This is a digital illustration of an elderly, bearded man portrayed against a plain white background. The man, who bears a resemblance to historical depictions of Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi, has a serene yet somber expression, with his eyes cast slightly downward. He has fair skin with age-softened features and a long, full white beard and mustache. On his head, he wears a large, ornate turban; it features a tall, conical golden cap with subtle arched engravings on top, around which a thick white cloth is intricately wrapped. A loose end of the white fabric hangs down the back of his head on the left side. His clothing is richly layered, starting with a flowing green cloak draped over his shoulders. Underneath, he wears a reddish-orange tunic that is trimmed with thick, light brown fur around the collar. The tunic is fastened down the center with a row of five small, dark buttons. The artwork has a painterly style, with the lower portions of his clothing and cloak trailing off into visible brushstrokes that blend into the white background.",
