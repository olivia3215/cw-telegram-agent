You are given a single image. Describe the scene so a reader can understand it without seeing the image. Include the most prominent objects, colors, relations, actions, and setting. If non-English text appears, describe the text and give its translation to English between parens. If mathematical problems are given, provide a complete description of the problems sufficient for the reader to understand and solve the problems. Output the description as a single string without markdown formatting.
