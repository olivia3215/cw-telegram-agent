# CALLOUT / REPLAN SEMANTICS â€” CURRENT BEHAVIOR vs INTENT (2025-09-14)
#
# Current behavior (observed in tests):
# - When a new message arrives for (agent_id, channel_id), we create a new
#   `received-<id>` TaskNode and keep it in the SAME TaskGraph instance.
# - We DO NOT delete/abort prior tasks. Both "callout" tasks (params.callout=True)
#   and regular (ephemeral) tasks remain present.
# - We DO NOT rewire dependencies; any existing depends_on links are left as-is.
# - We DO NOT distinguish DM vs Group here; no chat-type specific policy is applied.
#
# Evidence:
# - tests/test_integration.py::test_preserves_callout_tasks_when_replacing_graph
#   currently observes that the old regular task ("regular1") is still present
#   alongside the preserved callout ("callout1") plus the new "received-*" node.
#
# Known implications:
# - In group chats, keeping the old plan can cause the agent to remain "captured"
#   by a previous epoch unless upstream throttles replies.
# - In DMs, durable mini-plans (e.g., temporary block/unblock sequences) can be
#   disrupted by replans. We may want targeted preservation there.
#
# Proposed semantics (to be decided and then encoded in tests and code):
# - DMs: On replan, preserve callout tasks that aren't done; mark others aborted/done.
#         For preserved callouts, prune depends_on to preserved-only tasks to avoid
#         dangling dependencies. Optional: record `aborted_by: received-<id>` for
#         dropped/aborted tasks instead of deleting them.
# - Groups: On replan, hard reset (drop/abort everything) and keep only the new
#           "received-*" node; optionally add a debounce/budget to avoid ping-pong.
#
# Action items (future):
# - Decide and document the final policy (DM vs Group).
# - Update tests to reflect the chosen policy.
# - Implement pruning/aborting here in insert_received_task_for_conversation.
